This project focuses on five-class classification of ECG arrhythmia using ensemble learning methods. The dataset utilized is the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database from PhysioNet. We classify five types of arrhythmia by leveraging ensemble learning models, specifically combining SVM and Random Forest classifiers to enhance prediction accuracy. This work is based on the research article "Ensemble classifier fostered detection of arrhythmia using ECG data."
